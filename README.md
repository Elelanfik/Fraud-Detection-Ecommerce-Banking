# Fraud-Detection-Ecommerce-Banking1# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Banking Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on improving the detection of fraudulent activities in both e-commerce and banking transactions. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and comprehensive data analysis, we aim to create robust fraud detection models that effectively address the unique challenges posed by these transaction types.

## Project Objectives
- Enhance the accuracy of fraud detection models for e-commerce and bank credit transactions.
- Incorporate geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition into the detection process.
- Implement real-time monitoring and reporting to swiftly respond to fraudulent activities.

## Data Sources
1. **Fraud_Data.csv**: Contains e-commerce transaction data aimed at identifying fraudulent activities.
2. **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**: Maps IP addresses to their corresponding countries for geolocation analysis.
3. **creditcard.csv**: Contains bank transaction data specifically curated for fraud detection analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, data cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Feature Engineering**: Crafts features for effective fraud detection based on transaction patterns and user behavior.
- **Model Building**: Trains various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Real-time API**: Develops a Flask API for serving insights related to fraud detection.
- **Dashboard Visualization**: Creates an interactive dashboard using Flask and Dash to visualize crucial metrics and trends in fraud detection.
